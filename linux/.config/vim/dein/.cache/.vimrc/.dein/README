A darkish scheme which works in the GUI and in some 88 colour terminals (urxvt, for example) and 256 colour terminals (xterm with TERM=xterm-256 seems to work). This won't work in regular 8/16 colour terms, and depending upon your setup you may need to sacrifice a few goats to get the 88/256 things to work.

Keeping things up to date on vim.org is a nuisance. For the latest version, visit:
